# Sharing the insights &amp; methods for building Mydigitaltenniscoach

This repo demonstrates some of the core work that has been done to create My Digital Tennis Coach.

The data now comes from the Apple Watch.  This is high frequency measurements of Accelerometer and Gyroscope data.  

This is converted to shots upon which predictions are made.  

All of this is then combined to points and the outcomes of these are evaluated, so the data can be visualized in the app.

Currently shown here:
- Building of the Predictions via stacking xgboost models


To come:
- EDA - identification of shots
- Visualizations - New views of data which are not yet in the app but are interesting for performance
